    <!-- This example shows how to make sas data from an xml file with namespaces as tags
        name spaces are like <w:col2>, which is different from the plain tags like <col1>
        the 'w' before the colon is indeed an acronym/shortcut for the long string pointing to a URI
        in the file 'test3.xml', the URL is http://whatever.com/
        so the tag of col2, if not using the shortcut w, should be like 
        http://whatever.com/:col2 
        As it is too clumsy, the URI is replaced with the shortcut name 'w' (hence w:col2)

        to resolve xml with namespaces, 
        first, a tag <NAMESPACES> should be added in the beginning of the XMLMap file, in which the shortcuts are
        declared. Note: the URI must be the same as in the xml file (e.g., in the xml file, the xmlns:w="http://whatever.com/
            then here in this file, the attribute in the NS tag must be prefix="w">http://whatever.com/. SAS cannot render data if the URI are different)
        next, in the path, table, or colume names, the shortcut name like 'w' is replaced by the corresponding id
            declared in the NAMESPACES tag (in the case of 'w', the id is 1, so the original namespace in the xmlfile
            'w:col2' is changed to '{1}col2' )
        additionally but very importantly, the attribute of 'syntax="XPathENR"' must be added to the tag <PATH>, which
            is to tell SAS that the path contains ids for namespaces
        also, only SXLEMAP version 2.1 and above support the NAMESPACE declarations. version 1.0 does not support such declaration.
        and also, when make statement of libname in SAS code, ue the XMLV2 engine to read the version 2.1 SXLEMAP, instead of the engine XML
