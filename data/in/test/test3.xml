<!-- This example shows how to make sas data from an xml file with namespaces as tags
    name spaces are like <w:col2>, which is different from the plain tags like <col1>
    the 'w' before the colon is indeed an acronym for the long string pointing to a URI
    in the following case, the URL is http://whatever.com/
    so the tag of col2, if not using the short cut w, should be like 
    http://whatever.com/:col2 
    As it is too clumsy, the URI is replaced with the shortcut name 'w' (hence w:col2)
 -->
<w:body xmlns:w="http://whatever.com/" 
    xmlns:q="http://whatever.com/body">
    <q:table1>
        <w:col1>value of r1c1</w:col1>
        <w:col2>value of r1c2</w:col2>
    </q:table1>
</w:body>
